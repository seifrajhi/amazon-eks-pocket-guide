# Amazon EKS Pocket Guide

I am happy to announce the completion of a concise Amazon EKS pocket guide.

It is a small and easy-to-use document that helps you understand AWS EKS better.

Inside this booklet, I have taken great care to gather and explain all the important ideas and knowledge about Kubernetes features, best practices, and roadmap in a simple way. 

I'd love to hear what you think so I can make it even better. Perfect for reading on your next flight! ✈️
